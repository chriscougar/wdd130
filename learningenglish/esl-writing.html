                <h1>Writing</h1>
                <p>C.S. Lewis said, “You can make anything by writing.” Writing could be as tasty as a sandwich. Very yummy! Writing structure starts with a simple word. A word is a group of letters. With words, you can write phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and essays. You might find out at this point that writing is cool. You are ready now to tell your own stories by writing blogs or even a lot more than that writing a book.</p>

                <p>As we have seen a word is a group of letters. For example, a cat is a word with 3 letters. C + A + T. Then we are ready to write phrases.</p>
                <p>A phrase is a group of words without a subject. For example, keep it up. You can see that there are no people doing the action.</p>

                <h1>Sentences, Pragraphs & Essays</h1>

                <p>Later, we can write sentences. A sentence requires a subject plus a verb and an object and always ends with a period (.). For example, I like reading this article. (I) is the subject, (like reading) is the verb, and (this article) is the object and we end writing with a period. You can remember it with this technique (S + V + O + .). A paragraph is a self-contained unit of discourse in writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph consists of one or more sentences.</p>
                <p>An essay is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own argument. To be considered an essay, you need at least five paragraphs.</p>
