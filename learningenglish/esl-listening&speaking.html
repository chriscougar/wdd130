                <p> Stephen R. Covey said, “The biggest communication problem is we do not listen to understand. We listen to reply.” Speaking is something that we do every day. It is a natural habit. We must be careful when we speak in English. It is important to pay attention to pronunciation, on the other hand, we will not be understood by native English speakers. Kory Collier a mentor when I was in college said once “the way you speak is the way you listen”. The brain of an English speaker first recognizes the sound and then relates it to the word. That’s why they do not understand when we speak with a strong accent. We need to know as well that the least we speak the idea is clearer. For that reason, we need to know that listening is the harder part for every non-English speaker. There is a very common practice in English that is called abbreviation. An abbreviation is a contraction. It means that we reduce the word to make it shorter to say it faster. For example, hey y’all!, it’ll be warmer later, I gotta go. </p>
