      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My goal is to develop a website for people who are learning English as a second language. English is an important language that many people want to learn; however, it is hard. For that reason, I want to provide visual help to teach basic concepts in English. Visual learners will engage and will be my primary audience. The website will also help to connect with some teachers of English for private lessons. In that way, I will engage two types of audiences. Students and teachers. This website will help me personally since I work teaching English in Chile.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience will be anyone who is not an English native speaker. For that reason, I will be beyond any border from where I am. Any student who is willing to learn or improve his or her English skills is welcome to take advantage of this website. It will be easier for anyone to learn since the main teaching will be focused on learning visually. However, anyone else is very welcome to come and learn. As a teacher of English, I will be here for you and will be working hard for updates to help you learn in the best way you can.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>English for ESL (English as a Second Language) students</h3>
      <p>
        For many of you learning English has become a nightmare. You wonder and ask yourself why you want to learn this language and why it is hard for you to learn. Then, you remember that your job requires it, you want to study abroad, or even that nightmare is really your dream. You also know that with no mentor it becomes even more frustrating. However, take a deep breath and relax. On this website, you will learn basic techniques that will help you to improve the way you are learning. We will start with easier practice and technique. That will give you the motivation to keep going into the next practice that will become harder than the first one and so on. On this website, we will learn about Grammar, writing structure, and listening and speaking techniques.

      <h3>Grammar</h3>
      <p>
        Zadie Smith a grammarian said, “The past is always tense, the future perfect.” In English as in every language, we conjugate in tenses which means time. There are three main simple tenses in English. These are simple past and progressive, simple present and progressive, and future. See! simple to understand. We need to think about our own life experiences and visualize what happened before now, what is happening right now, and what will happen later. Now, we will call them to verb tenses. When you got this picture in your mind, you are ready to start learning the verb tenses.

      </ul>
      <h3>Writing Structure</h3>
      <p>
        C.S. Lewis said, “You can make anything by writing.” Writing could be as tasty as a sandwich. Very yummy! Writing structure starts with a simple word. A word is a group of letters. With words, you can write phrases, sentences, paragraphs, and essays. You might find out at this point that writing is cool. You are ready now to tell your own stories by writing blogs or even a lot more than that writing a book. 
        As we have seen a word is a group of letters. For example, a cat is a word with 3 letters. C + A + T. Then we are ready to write phrases. A phrase is a group of words without a subject. For example, keep it up. You can see that there are no people doing the action. Later, we can write sentences. A sentence requires a subject plus a verb and an object and always ends with a period (.). For example, I like reading this article. (I) is the subject, (like reading) is the verb, and (this article) is the object and we end writing with a period. You can remember it with this technique (S + V + O + .).
