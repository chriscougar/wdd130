    <h2>Chris</h2>
    <p>My name is Christopher Cortés from San Antonio, Chile. I am 33 years old and single. I am a teacher. As a teacher, I know the importance of growing academically. For that reason, I am majoring in the technology field. It is something that I always wanted to learn.</p>
    <p>I love to spend time outside in the nature. Almost every day, I go out and see the sunset. There are more than 7 types of beaches here. Some of them are cold and others colder. Lol. Another thing that I love to do is play the piano. I used to spend a lot of time playing and played in the sacrament meeting every Sunday.</p>
    <p>Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf said “For members of the Church, education is not merely a good idea-it’s a commandment.” In my life, I have seen the importance of lifting myself. I am so thankful to BYU Pathway and BYU-I for providing this opportunity to me to be a student in Zion.</p>
